# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore, the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5

# number = int(input('Please enter a number!: '))
# if number % 2 == 0 :
#     print(f'{number} is a even number.')
# else:
#     print(f'{number} is an odd number.')

# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
