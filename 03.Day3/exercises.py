# Exe 1
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore, the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5

# number = int(input('Please enter a number!: '))
# if number % 2 == 0 :
#     print(f'{number} is a even number.')
# else:
#     print(f'{number} is an odd number.')

# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# weight = float(input('What is your weight?: '))
# height = float(input('What is your height?: '))
# bmi = round(weight / (height * height), 2)
#
# if bmi <= 18.5:
#     print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.')
# elif bmi > 18.5 and bmi <= 25:
#     print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.')
# elif bmi > 25 and bmi <= 30:
#     print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.')
# elif bmi > 30 and bmi <= 35:
#     print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese!')
# else:
#     print(f'Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese!!!')
